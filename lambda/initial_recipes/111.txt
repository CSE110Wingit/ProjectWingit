Red Wine Wings

Chicken wings, canola oil, sesame oil, lemon juice, soy sauce, honey, hot sauce, hoisin sauce, garlic cloves, Woodbridge By Robert Mondavi Cabernet Sauvignon, sugar, tomato, molasses, corn starch, fresh thyme

Wings to munch after a long day . . . 

1. Combine marinade ingredients in a large bowl or in a ziplock bag, add the wings, shake and coat well with the mixture. Refrigerate for 1 hour or overnight.
2. Preheat oven to 350F.
3. Add 2 tablespoons of canola oil to a large baking pan, shake excess marinade off wings (don't discard) and place them in the baking pan, not overlapping.
4. Pour 1/2 of the marinade over the wings after 15 minutes of baking, pour the rest of the marinade after 30 minutes of baking. At this moment wings can be turned on the other side, for uniform baking and to avoid sticking to the pan.
5. Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, meat must come off the bone fairly easily and the wings should have a dark golden color.
6. While the wings are baking start on the red wine sticky glaze, it will take you 20-30 minutes to make it.
7. Add 1 cup of wine, sugar, molasses and tomato to a medium sauce pan and bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Boil on low heat until the glaze is thick and syrupy, about 15-20 minutes. Stir frequently.
8. Mix corn starch with the remaining 1/4 cup of wine to make a slurry and add it to the wine mixture. Stir and cook for another 5 minutes.
9. Turn off the heat and let the glaze rest for 10 minutes.
10. Remove wings from oven, place on a serving plate and pour the red wine sticky glaze over them. Let it stand for 10 minutes. Garnish with fresh thyme and serve.
