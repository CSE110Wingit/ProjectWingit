Honey Garlic Chicken Wings

chicken wings, flour, salt, pepper, olive oil, honey, soy sauce, garlic cloves, ginger, chili flakes, corn starch

These honey garlic chicken wings are sweet, sticky and loaded with garlic flavor.

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Dab wings with paper towels until completely dry.
2. Toss wings with flour, salt and pepper. Remove any excess flour and brush with olive oil (or use an olive oil spray).
3. Line a pan with foil and then place parchment paper on top (you may need 2 pans) and bake 35 minutes turning at 20 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, combine sauce ingredients in a small pan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer about 10 minutes or until slightly thickened and sauce coats the back of a spoon.
5. Take wings from oven, toss with sauce and return to the oven for 10 minutes, turning after 5 minutes.
6. Allow to cool 10 minutes. As the sauce cools, it thickens. Stir the wings every few minutes to coat in the sauce as it thickens.
