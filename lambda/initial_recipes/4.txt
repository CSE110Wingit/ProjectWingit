Make buffalo wings the easy way, by cooking them in the slow cooker! Made stress-free and loaded with mouthwatering finger-licking flavors!

1. In a small mixing bowl, add rub ingredients and stir to combine thoroughly.  Spray slow cooker with non-stick cooking spray and add chicken wings.  Sprinkle rub over the top and use hands to massage the rub into all the chicken wings.  I like to use nitrile gloves for this - easy clean up!
2. In the empty rub mixing bowl, add sauce ingredients and whisk to combine well.  Pour over spiced wings and toss gently to coat.
3. Cover slow cooker and cook on HIGH for 2 hours, or on LOW for 3-4 hours.
4. Cook slow cooker recipe as directed above.  Line a baking sheet with 2 sheets of aluminum foil, then place an oven safe wire cooling rack on top.  Place cooked wings on cooling rack, then pour sauce from the slow cooker into a saucepan.  Add 2 Tbsp cornstarch and 2 Tbsp of water to a small bowl and whisk to combine well, then pour into sauce and whisk.  Cook over MED-HIGH heat until boiling, then reduce heat to MED-LOW and whisk as it cooks.  Cook about 5 minutes, or until thickened to desired consistency. 
5. Brush wings with thickened sauce, then broil on HIGH for 2-3 minutes, until the sauce caramelizes a little.  Brush with more glaze and broil another 2 minutes.  Repeat this one more time and you should have perfectly sticky wings!
