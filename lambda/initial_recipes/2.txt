Sticky Thai Chicken Wings

chicken wings, sea salt, Thai sweet chili sauce, sugar, soy sauce, white vinegar, fish sauce, lime juice, lemongrass, garlic, sesame oil, cilantro, onions, chili flakes

Sticky Thai Chicken Wings glazed with a sticky sauce infused with authentic Thai flavours you most probably already have on hand in the kitchen!

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly spray a large baking tray with cooking oil spray; set aside.
2. To prepare the glaze, combine all of the glaze ingredients in a small bowl or jug; whisk until combined. Pour half of the sauce into a small saucepan and reserve for later.
3. Trim any excess skin off of the wing edges. Season with salt to taste. Place the wings on the prepared baking tray; pour the sauce over the wings and toss to coat evenly. Arrange the wings in a single layer and bake for 10-15 minutes.
4. While the wings are in the oven, bring the remaining glaze to a simmer on low-medium heat, until the sauce bubbles up and begins to thicken (it should take about 5 minutes).
5. Once the chicken wings are cooked on the one side, rotate each piece and bake again for an extra 10 minutes. Change oven settings to grill (or broil) on a medium-high heat setting; baste wings with half of the ready-made glaze and allow to crisp up for a further 5 minutes. They will look golden and shiny from the glaze.
6. Once the wings are golden, remove them from the oven and baste again with glaze. Garnish with the cilantro, onion slices, chilli flakes and sprinkle with salt (if needed). Serve with any remaining glaze for dipping!
