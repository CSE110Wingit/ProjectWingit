A recipe to enjoy while relaxing on the beach.

1. Mix all ingredients except chicken wings in a bowl. 
2. Reserve half of the marinade and set aside. 
3. Put the rest of the marinade, along with the chicken wings, in a zip top bag and seal tight, removing all air. 
4. Shake to coat. 
5. Refrigerate 2 hours or overnight. 
6. Remove wings from marinade, scrape off excess solids from wings and reserve marinade. 
7. Grill over medium-high heat, turning wings constantly to ensure even charring, for 20 to 30 min. or until wings reach at least 165 degrees on a meat thermometer. Tip: If wings are charring too quickly, turn heat down to medium or medium-low to finish cooking. 
8. Pour reserved marinade into a saucepan and simmer until slightly thickened. 
9. Transfer wings to a platter and spoon the warm lime sauce on top.
