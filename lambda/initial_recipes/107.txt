Cinnamon Roll Styled Chicken Wings

chicken wings, peanut oil, flour, salt, black pepper, McCormick's Cinnamon Sugar

A sweet, sweet recipe when you're in the mood for a Cinnabon but would rather eat chicken wings!

1. Soak wings in brine to remove impurities for about 30-60 minutes. Then rinse with cold water.
2. Cut wings at joints with kitchen shears (save the tips and freeze them for stock).
3. Combine flour, salt and pepper in large bowl or plate for dredging.
4. Sprinkle lightly with McCormick's Cinnamon Sugar (resist the temptation to be liberal; that can make the skin gooey).
5. Pat wings dry.
6. Heat oil in electric skillet to 375 degrees.
7. Dredge sugared wings into flour mixture. Remember to shake off excess flour.
8. Put no more than 8-10 pieces into skillet at a time. Cook until golden brown and crispy.
9. Drain cooked wings on newspaper or grocery bags. Don't use paper towels - this makes them soggy. I know it sounds like it takes forever, but this is just an estimated time.
10. If you want to make more, just replenish your flour mixture, and you shouldn't need anymore oil. I know it's a lot of oil, but these wings MUST be deep-fried to enjoy the taste. Eat them with fries or salad. They go great with a nice pinot grigio too.
